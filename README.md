## Introduction:
  Have you thought about how difficult it is to make a piece of toast or peel an apple when you have mobility in only one hand? Some tasks are big challenges and if we can help people to manage those tasks efficiently, the impact can be life changing. 
  We read stories online and found out that differently abled people found it difficult to connect with people on conventional social media and community platforms. It was also pointed out that there is no community solution built for people with a disability that makes them feel comfortable and also adds value to their lives. 
  Team Celestial Biscuit thought, if we are able to make the differently abled users celebrate their small wins, they will definitely feel motivated to share their story with others as well. 
  
  Let's look at the story of John: He is a Young man living with Hemiplegia on left side of upper body. He does not want to depend on his carer for making his meals everyday & to clean up afterwards. He wants to be able to take care of himself. He wants to share his ideas & creative hacks with others. He wants to connect with like-minded people. 
  
  To provide the differently abled people with a platform to share their life hacks and engage in a like-minded community, we came up with Sharability. The pandemic has taken a toll on all of us be it the richest of the richest, the smartest of the smartest and the most fortunate of the most fortunate. While the world was crumbling under the pangs of COVID-19, team Celestial Biscuit came up with this solution for the differently abled to make their lives easier during the pandemic. This platform is indeed a boon for those who are dependent on their carers for their daily needs. The users can look for a life hack for a problem they need to solve and voila, they can enjoy their lives to the fullest even after being stuck at home alone. John finds out about this platform to support people with disabilities and their carers. This webapp aims to help the people in their daily needs. App matches John's needs. John discovered a way to toast with one hand and using sharability, he can share his life hack. He can upload a video, or an audio or even write a paragraph about his hack. He also selects the tags to help others in the search. Community members can connect and support each other. John can now make friends along with motivating and helping others in his community. He no longer feels alone.

  3) Sharing of life hacks for a user is fairly easy and accessible. It is a four step process wherein the user has to submit a form containing four questions - title of the story, what challenge were they facing, what was their solution and upload a video, image or an audio.
